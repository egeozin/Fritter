#Fritter

An app that allows short and timely communication between users. Users can post and delete tweets(freets), and see the tweets of other users. They can register accounts with a username and password. Attempt to register with an existing username fails. Users can login while server authenticates the credentials. They can also retweet tweets of other users. Finally, users can follow each other and each user sees the tweets and retweets of followed users in their home page.
